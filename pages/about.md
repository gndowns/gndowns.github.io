My name is Gabriel Downs. I currently live in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
I graduated in May, 2019 from McGill University with a B.A. in Honours Math and
Computer Science. I now work as a Data Scientist and Developer at 
[Tactio Health Group](https://www.tactiohealth.com/).

While at McGill I did Computer Vision research with
[Professor Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/)
and
[Morteza Rezanejad](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~morteza/)
in the
[Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/?page=main) at the Centre for Intelligent Machines
