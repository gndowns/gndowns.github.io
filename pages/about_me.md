title: About Me
---

I graduated in May, 2019 from McGill University with
a B.A. in Honours Math and Computer Science. 
I am now a software developer and researcher in the
[Metalab](https://sat.qc.ca/en/recherche/metalab) at the
[Société des arts technologiques](https://sat.qc.ca/en) in Montreal, where I
develop open source software for immersive audio and video.

While at McGill, I worked as a Computer Vision researcher with
[Professor Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/)
and
[Morteza Rezanejad](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~morteza/)
in the
[Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/?page=main)
at the Centre for Intelligent Machines.
Within the group I helped examine the role of contour geometry in human and
computer vision for scene categorization. You can read more about our work
