Some good beginner programs for mixing / DJing:

### Mixing Software
- [mixxx](mixxx.org): mixxx is my personal favourite program for mixing, since
it is free and open source. It also runs on Linux. You can find the full source
code on [github](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx).

- [djay Pro](https://www.algoriddim.com/): djay is a great program for
beginners since it integrates with Spotify, so you don't have to download a lot
of music to get started. (**Note**: only for Windows and Mac)
