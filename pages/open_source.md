I am a big fan of free and open source software.
Here are some of my favourite open source projects which I contribute to, use,
or otherwise support.

### Contributions
- [Metalab](https://gitlab.com/sat-metalab):
I currently work at the Metalab at the [SAT](https://sat.qc.ca/en) in Montreal.
All of our projects are open source and available on GitLab.
- [DeepEvolve](https://https://github.com/jliphard/DeepEvolve):
Hyperparameter search for neural networks using genetic algorithms,
by [Jan Liphardt](https://liphardtlab.stanford.edu/) of Stanford University.
I added a feature to allow for a different number of filters at each layer of
the generated CNNs.

- [AOF Skeletons](https://github.com/mrezanejad/AOFSkeletons):
A library for computing the medial axis of binary images, designed in Prof.
Siddiqi's [lab](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/) at McGill.
I wrote all documentation.

### Projects I Use and Support
- [mixxx](https://mixxx.org): A great free and open souce program for live 
DJing.

- [Keras](https://keras.io): My preferred library for all deep learning work.
Plays well with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).
Code is available on [github](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).

- [DVC](https://https://dvc.org/): A tool to version control your datasets,
hyperparameters, and results for machine learning experiments.

### My Own Repos
I maintain all of my own open source projects on GitHub.
You can find them on my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/gndowns).
