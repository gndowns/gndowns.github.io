Here are some of my favourite open source projects which I contribute to, use,
or otherwise support.

### Contributions
- [DeepEvolve](https://https://github.com/jliphard/DeepEvolve):
Hyperparameter search for neural networks using genetic algorithms,
by [Jan Liphardt](https://liphardtlab.stanford.edu/) of Stanford University.
I added a feature to allow for a different number of filters at each layer of
the generated CNNs.

### Projects I Use and Support
- [mixxx](https://mixxx.org): A great free and open souce program for live 
DJing.

- [DVC](https://https://dvc.org/): A tool to version control your datasets,
hyperparameters, and results for machine learning experiments.
