At the [SAT Metalab](https://sat.qc.ca/fr/recherche/metalab)
we've just started on a project called
[Spook](https://gitlab.com/sat-metalab/spook),
which uses multiple popular pose estimation algorithms to track user skeletons
and movements, and outputs the data in OSC and Websocket formats.

Currently the user can choose between the
[OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
and [Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)
pose estimation algorithms.

The user can also add any of several available "filters" to the output. The
"armup filter," for example, outputs whether the user has either of their arms
raised above their head. These filter outputs can be used to trigger different
events through user actions, adding a "hands-free" user interface based solely
on movements and gestures.

All code for the project is free and open source on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sat-metalab/spook).
