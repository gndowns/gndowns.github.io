In 2018 I worked as a Computer Vision Researcher under
[Professor Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and
[Morteza Rezanejad](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~morteza/) in the
[Shape Analysis Group](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/?page=main) at the
McGill Centre For Intelligent Machines.
The paper I collaborated on has now been accepted to
[CVPR 2019](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)!
You can find our paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10524) or on the
official
[CVPR site](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Rezanejad_Scene_Categorization_From_Contours_Medial_Axis_Based_Salience_Measures_CVPR_2019_paper.html).
