Souvenir is a prototype of a tool to create a virtual memory palace,
a popular menmonic device which leverages humans' strong spatial memory.

I first created Souvenir at YHack 2016 with
[Nick Greene](https://github.com/nickgreene),
[Connor Maggio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmaggio10/),
and Donald Della Pietra.
We won first prize for our demo at the event out of over 1,000 competing students.

You can read more about it at our
[devpost](https://devpost.com/software/souvenir),
or try our live [demo](http://souvenir-to-remember.herokuapp.com/).

The code is all open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/gndowns/Souvenir).
