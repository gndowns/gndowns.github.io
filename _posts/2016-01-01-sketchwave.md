[SketchWave.tech](https://sketchwave.tech) is a fun drawing-based messenger app
I helped out with in first year. The site won a Top 10 prize at the 2016
Mchacks hackathon. It was entirely coded up by
[David Lougheed](https://github.com/davidlougheed), with graphic design by
Aidon Lebar, and a little inpsiration and moral support from myself.
Check out the demon on the [homepage](https://sketchwave.tech) or see the full
[code](https://github.com/davidlougheed/sketchwave) on GitHub.
