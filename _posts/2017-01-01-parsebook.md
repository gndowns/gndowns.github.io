[ParseBook](https://github.com/gndowns/ParseBook)
is a python script to scrape and parse your facebook messenger data
into a single organized json object. 

Anyone can download their complete facebook message history from facebook 
[directly](https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992),
but parsing of the data by this program allows for easier search and analysis
of conversations.
This code is also significantly faster than other facebook message parsers
since it does not rely on libraries like BeautifulSoup.

This code was written as part of a larger chatbot project which won
3rd place at the McHacks 2017 hackathon. 

The full code is available on [github](https://github.com/gndowns/ParseBook).
